# UFOs
## Overview of project

Unidentified flying objects (also known as UFOs) are commonly associated with magical beliefs that allow the existence of extraterrestrial life and alien abductions. Thus, UFO experiences describe contact with UFOs, extraterrestrial beings, secret extraterrestrial visits, and abductions. The purpose of this analysis is to find patterns and relationships between the location and time of UFO sightings to better understand UFO data from a spatial science perspective.

## Results

### Based on Country

Our first parameter of this analysis is the country, "According to the data, which country has seen the UFOs at most". The screenshot below shows that the United States has had 109 more sightings than Canada which has only 2. Because NUFORC is an American institution, most Americans were confident in their ability to report what they witnessed. The above figures support the idea that the United States has a higher density of sightings than the other country. Now we can check how they're spread among the states here in the US.

### Based on States

As we have analyzed that the United States has the most and densest sightings; the amount of sightings in each state can be analyzed here.
When analyzed the states data, it is found that the "ca", California has the highest sightings, i.e 30 and "fl", Florida comes at second place with 10 sightings. Below is the supporting image which has been taken from the webpage of ca and fl search along with the bar graph of top 3 states that has the most number of sightings.

### Based on City

In our previous analysis we have found that California has the greatest number of sightings. So we have dug more about what cities have the most sightings.
City named "el cajon" has the most number of sightings in California, US. Below image depicts the same.

### Based on Shapes

After analyzing the location of the UFOs sightings, another parameter that we have searched and analyzed to know more in-depth data is the shape of the UFOs. The bar chart created using the web page search results it is found that the most common shape mentioned is a generic shape labelled "light," which is commonly mistaken for a dazzling halo by those who have experienced this experience. Another very common shape was "triangle". Below is the bar chart along with the images to illustrate the above outcomes.

### Based on Shapes and Location and date

As we have analyzed that California, US has the most number of sightings, so we have analyzed the correlation between the location and shape, results that the "light" shape was the seen mostly by the people on the new year's day on 1/1/2010. As per our analysis these numbers decreased over time. Also, it was observed that the numbers were consistent 10 days after the New Year.

## Summary

To summarize, the data shows that the United States, namely the state of California, has the most sightings. However, it's worth noting that Florida has a larger population density than California in terms of population density.
It's also worth mentioning that the "light" form is the most often reported of all time in both countries. Over time, the number of sightings and reports appears to have decreased. Because we just have information about sightings, we can't tell if aliens exist or not based on this research.
The limitation of this webpage is that it doesn't have the complement filter which can be very useful in analysis in depth. That can be added in the future development.
This webpage can also be used in generating survey and analytics reports, Along with that adding more filters such as the date range or the duration of the sightings can also be very helpful that can be implemented in future.
